## Git Commands
- Create new branch:
`
git checkout -b <branch_name>
`
  - `<branch_name>` should follow the conventions: `feature/some_feature`, `improve/some_improvement`, `fix/some_bug`, etc.
- Change branch: `git checkout <branch_name>`
- Add new code to branch: `git add -u`
- Commit: `git commit -m "<some_message>"`:
  - `<some_message>` can be anything but showing what you have done, what are the changes, etc. should be better
- Push to repository: `git push`
